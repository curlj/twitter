#fun-twitter-bot

Twitter bot that I made for fun. 

It is connected to the twitter.com/boringpostsonly twitter account and is now inactive. 

The bot automatically searches how many times pre-specified terms were used on twitter in the past 24 hours, each day. 
--> In the most recent version, the terms were '#potatoes', '#oklahoma', '#bored', '#flatearth'.
